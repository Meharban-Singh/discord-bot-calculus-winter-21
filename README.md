# Calculus Bot Discord bot 

This is a discord bot to help us study calculus during covid.

### Set up:

Simply download the code and create a discord bot on discord developers' portal. Add the signing key of the bot from discord portal to a file named `.env`. To do that, create a new file called `.env` in the main directory and add the following:

```php
BOT_TOKEN='<paste your discord bot signing key here>'
```

Yes, thats it :)

### The list of commands supported by the bot are:

```
$hello OR $hi -> Greetings! :)

$help OR $commands -> Bring this text up again

$theorems OR $proofs OR $$definitions OR $def -> list all theorems taught so far in the course

$theorem num OR $th num OR $proof num -> Provides solution of theorem number 'num'

$maths OR $mathshelp OR =maths OR =mathshelp -> maths help

$anime X Y -> searches the anime/manga/character Y. X is the
type of search (anime or character or manga), and Y is the search query

$legends -> List all LEGENDS of the server
```
